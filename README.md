# Cricket Data Analysis Project

This project contains a set of dbt models for analyzing cricket match data. The models transform raw match data into structured tables that can be used for various analyses and insights.

## Available Models

### 1. raw_matches

This is the base model that contains the raw match data.

**Columns:**

- match_id
- match_data (JSONB containing all match details)

### 2. match_details

This model extracts key information from the raw match data.

**Columns:**

- match_id
- series_name
- match_num
- match_stage
- match_type
- match_type_num
- team_type
- format
- season
- player_of_match
- match_dates
- num_days
- venue
- toss_winner
- toss_decision
- outcome
- team1
- team2
- winner
- win_by_wickets
- win_by_runs
- win_by_innings

### 3. playing_xi

This model extracts the playing XI for each team in each match.

**Columns:**

- match_id
- player_id
- player_name
- team_name

## Relationships

The relationships between these models are as follows:

1. `raw_matches` is the source for both `match_details` and `playing_xi`.
2. `match_details` and `playing_xi` are linked by the `match_id` column.

You can visualize these relationships in the following diagrams:

- **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**: ![DAG](dag.png)

## Data Ingestion

The raw match data is ingested into the `raw_matches` table using the code available in the [cricbit repository](https://github.com/prateekb1912/cricbit). This repository contains the necessary scripts and tools to fetch and load the cricket match data into our database.
